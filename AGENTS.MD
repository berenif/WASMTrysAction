## Roguelike Game - Core Loop Implementation

### Project Overview
A modern roguelike game implementing an 8-phase core gameplay loop designed for maximum player engagement and replayability.

### Repository
- **Location**: `/workspace/roguelike-game`
- **Status**: In Development (Phase 1 - Core Systems)
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: Pygame 2.5+

### Core Gameplay Loop
The game implements a carefully crafted 8-phase loop:

1. **Explore** → Read space fast, spot threats, discover rewards
2. **Fight** → Express skill under pressure with telegraphs and i-frames
3. **Choose** → Draft run identity through meaningful tradeoffs
4. **Power-up** → Feel immediate strength gains
5. **Push Your Luck** → Opt into risk for better rewards
6. **Escalate** → Face new problems, not just bigger numbers
7. **Cash-out** → Make tough economic decisions
8. **Reset** → Fail fast, try again with new knowledge

### Technical Architecture

#### Systems Implementation
- **Exploration System**: Fog of war, room discovery, landmark navigation
- **Combat System**: Telegraph-based combat, dodge mechanics, enemy AI
- **Choice System**: 3-option selection with clear tradeoffs
- **Power-up System**: Immediate stat boosts and ability unlocks
- **Risk/Reward System**: Elite encounters, curses, timed challenges
- **Escalation System**: Biome progression, difficulty scaling
- **Economy System**: Multi-currency shop with strategic purchases
- **Reset System**: Quick restart with meta-progression

#### Key Features
- **Procedural Generation**: Dynamic room layouts and enemy placement
- **Build Variety**: Multiple viable playstyles and synergies
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear telegraphs and state indicators
- **Performance**: 60 FPS target with sub-3 second load times
- **Meta Progression**: Unlockables and persistent upgrades

```

### Running the Game
```bash
cd /workspace/roguelike-game
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

### Design Philosophy
The game focuses on:
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every action has clear, instant results
- **Meaningful Choices**: No false choices, every option is viable
- **Escalating Tension**: Difficulty ramps up with new mechanics, not just numbers
- **Quick Iteration**: Fast restarts encourage "one more run" gameplay

### Next Steps
1. Complete core system testing
2. Implement visual and audio polish
3. Balance gameplay through playtesting
4. Add meta-progression systems
5. Prepare for distribution

### Success Metrics
- Average session: 30-45 minutes
- Death-to-restart: <5 seconds
- 10+ viable build paths
- 80%+ positive playtester feedback
